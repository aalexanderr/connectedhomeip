name: 3.12.5. [TC-CONTENTLAUNCHER-10.6] Launch URL Verification (DUT as Client)

          Commission TH to DUT, if not done so already. In some cases, such as with a Casting Video Player, the TH commissions the DUT.

          Product maker needs to provide instructions for how to trigger the command on the DUT. For comparison, the DUT behavior for this test step can be simulated using chip-tool (when DUT is a commissioner) or tv-casting-app (when DUT is a commissionee):

          ./chip-tool contentlauncher launch-url 'https://www.foo.com' '{"providerName": "provider"}' 1 1
          ./chip-tv-casting-app contentlauncher launch-url 'https://www.foo.com' '{"providerName": "provider"}' 1 1

          On TH (tv-app), Verify the  launch url command is received successfully.
